my_zigzag_object$mcmc(sample_frequency = 100, ngen = 10000, target_ESS = NULL,
progress_plot = FALSE, write_to_files = TRUE, mcmcprefix = "out",
compute_probs = TRUE, run_posterior_predictive = FALSE, append = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_frequency}{Number of generations between samples from the chain}

\item{ngen}{Number of generations to run the chain}

\item{target_ESS}{Run chain until the target effective sample size is achieved for the likelihood}

\item{write_to_files}{Write posterior samples to output files located in mcmcprefix_mcmc_ouput directory}

\item{mcmcprefix}{prefix for mcmc output directory as well as the output files within.}

\item{compute_probs}{compute probabilities of activity for each gene. Default is TRUE.}

\item{run_posterior_predictive}{run 500 posterior predictive simulation using parameters sampled from the chain.}

\item{run_posterior_predictive_and_plot}{run posterior predictive simulation and plot 50 simulated densities over observed densities.}

\item{append}{If posterior sample log files in mcmcprefix_mcmc_ouput already exists, then append samples to those files. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
Posterior log files including probability of active expression and MCMC diagnostics in mcmc_report directory.
